            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control recognizes changes made to a file and saves these changes so that the previous versions of the file can be revisited in the future. Using a Version Control System allows you to go back to previous versions of a file so that you can completely revert the file back to a previous version or see the previous changes that were made to the file. I find the general topic of Version Control Systems interesting due to the fact that I did not expect the computer programming world to have something that seems like a shortcut. Version Control Systems are relevant to our course because in future assignments it would be very beneficial to be able to revert our files to a previous version if we make a mistake.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three different types of Version Control Systems. One type is a Local Version Control System. This type of Version Control System is when the user simply duplicates their files and saves them to another directory. Time stamps can be added for extra convenience. When I think of Local Version Control Systems I automatically think of the way Microsoft Word saves your document as you are working on it. This is done so that if your computer crashes or the battery dies, you can recover the previous version of the document that was saved. This is very similar to the way a Local Version Control System saves previous versions of your files. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The second type of Version Control System is the Centralized Version Control System. This type of Version Control System makes it possible for the user to collaborate with other users even though the other users are on other systems. With Centralized VCS, all of the files are stored on one server that is accessible by the other users. With this type of system, the system administrators are able to control who can do what and what they have access to. This prevents other users from being able to make changes to things they don’t need to be able to change.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The third type of Version Control System is the Distributed Version Control System. This type of Version Control System saves the full history of the file. This means that any of the user’s files can be restored if something goes wrong but instead of saving the files as different versions, it saves all of the data from the file. I feel that this type of system is almost a combination of Centralized Version Control Systems and Local Version Control Systems with an added bonus that can greatly benefit all of the systems users. This is relevant to our course because as a class it could be beneficial for us to all use the same Distributed Version Control System.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Distributed Version Control System. Git is different from other types of Version Control Systems because instead of saving only what was changed in a file from a previous version, it saves every version how it was at that time like a screenshot. I find Git interesting because before using it myself, it was hard to grasp the concept of how it works. Git is relevant to our course because it is the specific Version Control System we are using with our Cloud9 accounts. I think it will be very interesting to see how much I benefit from Git as we move on to more difficult topics where we continue to use it.</p>
